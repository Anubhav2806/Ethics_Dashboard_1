Choose DBMS:
  We will use SQL as our DDL/DML with MySQL as the DBMS. This decision was made almost entirely due to the familiarity the developers hold with these 
  software. There are numerous other advantages that are covered in the Pros/Cons sections that werenâ€™t explicitly used as rationale upon the initial discussion.

Pros and Cons of Selected Technologies:
  HTML Advantages:
    World Wide Web standard.
    Most popular markup language by far.
    Well understood by most professional developers, and maintenance.
    Intuitive structure.
  CSS Advantages:
    Supports various markup languages but most widely HTML.
    Most popular of its kind for web development.
    Global styles can be applied to many or all pages in the application easily, since the general look of the application will be similar across all pages. Specific 
    changes can be made in stylesheets specific to the page. This abstraction will be helpful given the volume of pages in the application.
    Well understood by mostly anyone familiar with HTML; further developments, style changes, and maintenance will be easy.
  JavaScript Advantages:
    Extremely flexible language.
    Most popular of its kind for web development
    Alongside HTML and CSS forms the standard web development framework.
    Again, well understood by mostly anyone familiar with HTML.
  Django Advantages:
    Based in Python, an extremely flexible language.
    Not the most popular, though still very popular.
    Large support.
    All developers working on this until rollout are familiar with Python, and some are already very familiar with Django
  Django Disadvantages:
    Not as ubiquitous as PHP - which holds nearly four-fifths of the server-side web.
    Not all developers working on this project until rollout are totally familiar with Django - yet.
  SQL Advantages:
    Most popular query language for relational databases.
    Massive support and documentation.
    Team is familiar with SQL, and most developers familiar with web programming will be too.
  MySQL Advantages:
    Most popular DBMS.
    Massive support and documentation, backed by Oracle.
    Supported by numerous hosts.
