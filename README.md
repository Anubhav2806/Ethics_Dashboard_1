# Ethics_Dashboard_1
Project repository for the COSC 499 Ethics Dashboard Group 1

**Query Language and DBMS:**

>Our choices and some rationale:

    We will use SQL as our DDL/DML with MySQL as the DBMS. This decision was made almost entirely due to the familiarity the developers hold with these 
    software. There are numerous other advantages that are covered in the Pros/Cons sections that werenâ€™t explicitly used as rationale upon the initial discussion.

**Pros and Cons of Selected Technologies:**

>HTML Advantages:

    World Wide Web standard.
    Most popular markup language by far.
    Well understood by most professional developers, and maintenance.
    Intuitive structure.
    
>CSS Advantages:

    Supports various markup languages but most widely HTML.
    Most popular of its kind for web development.
    Global styles can be applied to many or all pages in the application easily, since the general look of the application will be similar across all pages. Specific 
    changes can be made in stylesheets specific to the page. This abstraction will be helpful given the volume of pages in the application.
    Well understood by mostly anyone familiar with HTML; further developments, style changes, and maintenance will be easy.
    
>JavaScript Advantages:

    Extremely flexible language.
    Most popular of its kind for web development
    Alongside HTML and CSS forms the standard web development framework.
    Again, well understood by mostly anyone familiar with HTML.
    
>Django Advantages:

    Based in Python, an extremely flexible language.
    Not the most popular, though still very popular.
    Large support.
    All developers working on this until rollout are familiar with Python, and some are already very familiar with Django
    
>Django Disadvantages:

    Not as ubiquitous as PHP - which holds nearly four-fifths of the server-side web.
    Not all developers working on this project until rollout are totally familiar with Django - yet.
    
>SQL Advantages:

    Most popular query language for relational databases.
    Massive support and documentation.
    Team is familiar with SQL, and most developers familiar with web programming will be too.
    
>MySQL Advantages:

    Most popular DBMS.
    Massive support and documentation, backed by Oracle.
    Supported by numerous hosts.

>Users of the application and stakeholders:

    The users of the app include professors, students, and TAs. 
    The stakeholders include: 
        Professors as they are the ones using the platform in their classes
        Students as they are the ones who will be learning and doing assignments on the app
        TAs as they will be using the app to work (as in grading)
        The institutions that this will be implemented at
        The capstone team developing the project as they want it to work in order to gain successful experience and receive a good grade in the class
        Any future software teams looking to add to this project and further develop it

>What are we using for the backend:

    The backend will be built using python/Django as the framework since it is flexible and easy to use and learn which would allow our back end development to be simple, yet       effective and dynamic. 
    Django would also be best as it may allow us to implement some artificial intelligence or machine learning feature either for the current project or in the         future. 
    Using python will also make the project very easy to maintain for the future evolutions of the project.
    
**Testing Strategies:**
>Methods for testing the project which can be filtered down to Agile and Waterfall testing

>Agile:

    -We would allow for better team collaboration and is better for quicker projects where time is limited.
    -Code is tested with each iteration in the development phase
    -Allows us to have customer feedback with every design iteration
    -Would allow us to use scrums and sprints throughout the development period
    Therefore we can implement sprint periods where developers develop solely on code and QA testers can focus on debugging and fixing code. During the end of sprint cycles we can implement and acknowledge customer feedback

>Waterfall:

    -Detailing our project and code allows all team members to easily to understand the code and assist when needed
    -Documentation of the project allows for clearer vision of scope and what the customer expects of the project
    Therefore while the waterfall testing strategy may take longer it will benefit us in the long run by having clearer communications with the client and a steadier timeline with the project.

**Main Features**
>The end goal of the project is to allow students to use it for learning case studies and for the project to be easily maintainable for future developers.

>Short Term development 

    -The dashboard must be hosted on Canadian server
    -We will be using MySQL to implement the database
    -Easy to read documentation for maintenance
    -Students should be able to work on multiple case studies at a time
    -An AI to prevent plagiarism 
    -Detail inputs to ensure students stay engaged during use
    -An AI to insure students stay relevant to the course material and understand the learning goals
    -Gut reactions, the app will require a systematic analysis of the ethics

>Long Term development

    -A mobile version of the app 
    -The integration of more game-like inputs 
    -An AI capable of providing immediate feedback to students as they work through a case 
    -Eventually, the AI should be capable of taking on all evaluative tasks for case analysis 
    
**Creative Exploration:**
We can explore many different aesthetics using CSS and play around with different looks and color combinations. We may also look into using bootstrap to aid in the look of the application. For better functionality, we can play around with things such as changing the button placement to make it more user friendly.
